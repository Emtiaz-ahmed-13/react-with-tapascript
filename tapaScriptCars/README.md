# TapaScript Cars

**TapaScript Cars** is a website showcasing some of the most luxurious and expensive cars in the world. The site features a logo, a search bar to find cars by name, and a list of sample cars with details such as the car's name, brand, year of production, and price. To run the project locally, clone the repository and install the required dependencies by running `yarn` in the project directory. Once dependencies are installed, you can start the development server using `yarn start`. 

The **Component Breakdown Diagram** provides insight into the structure of the site, illustrating the components used and their relationships.

The **Component Hierarchy Diagram** helps visualize the data flow within the application, showing how each component is connected. These diagrams are useful for understanding the applicationâ€™s architecture and its data flow. This project allows users to filter cars based on search terms and premium status, with a responsive and modern design suitable for various screen sizes. You can clone the project, modify it, and build upon it to create a customized car listing site.
